# The relationship between unexpected real-world events, Twitter-inferred sur-prisingness and risk-taking behaviours
Social media posts present a unique opportunity to study real-time emotional responses to current events on a massive scale. At the same time, changes in emotional states have been found to influence cognitive processing ability and hence behaviours, such as the propensity to take risks. This repository contains :
1)	feature engineering of sentiment scores of over 250,000 sports related Tweets,
2)	statistical analysis to determine whether the unexpectedness of sporting outcomes can be inferred from changes in sport related tweets
3)	Having confirmed point 2 and following behavioural science research that unexpected events lead to increased risk taking, statistical analysis to determine whether changes in twitter sentiment are predictive of increased risk-taking post unexpected events (lottery ticket sales)
