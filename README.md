# The relationship between unexpected real-world events, Twitter-inferred sur-prisingness and risk-taking behaviours
## Abstract
Social media posts present a unique opportunity to study real-time emotional responses to current events on a massive scale. At the same time, changes in emotional states have been found to influence cognitive processing ability and hence behaviours, such as the propensity to take risks. Two largely separate bodies of literature have studied the effect of unexpected real-world events, through the lens of their impact on affective states. The first finds that unexpected events create seemingly extraneous effects- including increased gambling be-haviour, whilst the second studies the influence of unexpected events on Twitter-inferred mood, finding that they result in larger changes in sentiment than those that are in-line with expectations. In this paper, we explore the interconnect between these two strands of liter-ature. First, we examine the relationship between unexpected sports outcomes of five New York based teams and the degree of surprisingness displayed in a large dataset of tweets. In support of the literature, we find that unexpected sports outcomes do indeed predict daily sentiment prediction errors. Second, we ask whether Twitter-inferred surprisingness is re-lated to real-world gambling, measured as lottery ticket sales, finding no evidence in our dataset of such a relationship.
